            It all started with a Nikon D3100 in 2010. The beauty from the first moment I captured was stunning. Photography became a hobby after that. Now, it's a passion. From sporadic nature shots to full on photo shoots, it's been a wonderful journey... all the way up to the Nikon D800! Each image takes the subject(s) to a completely different level. It brings so much joy to know that the emotions from that one second are immortalized through something so simple as a shutter. Click -- the memory lasts forever   ~ â™¥ ~
